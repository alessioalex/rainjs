===============
Error component
===============

Error component is used to define error views for various HTTP error cases.
In this way, the developer will have full control over what will be displayed for a specific
HTTP error code. In order to achieve this, this component will contain a view for each HTTP
error code for which a custom message should be shown. If such a view doesn't exist a default
view will be shown.

-----
Usage
-----

By default this component is auto-discovered by the platform, but you can change the default
settings in the ``server.conf`` file.

.............
Configuration
.............

As a convention, this component is named ``error`` and the platform will always use
the latest version. However, you can override this behavior in the ``server.conf`` file by using
the following configuration options (version is optional and if it isn't specified, the latest
version will be used):

.. code-block:: javascript

    "errorComponent" : {
        "name": "error",
        "version": "2.3"
    }

............
View Example
............

The following example shows how the view for the 500 error code can look like:

.. code-block:: html

    {{css path="index.css"}}

    <div class="content">
        <h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1>
        <p>
            An unexpected condition was encountered. Please try the request again.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            {{{error.stack}}}
        </p>
    </div>

.........
meta.json
.........

This is the ``meta.json`` for this component. To specify a custom message for a error you add a
view for which the view id is the same as the error code. If a view for an error doesn't exist,
the `default` view will be displayed:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "id": "error_pages",
        "version": "1.0",
        "views": {
            "default": {
                "view": "default.html",
                "controller": {
                    "client": "default.js"
                }
            },
            "404" : {
                "view": "404.html",
                "controller": {
                    "client": "404.js"
                }
            },
            "500" : {
                "view": "500.html",
                "controller": {
                    "client": "500.js"
                }
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

    Each view can have a different client-side controller.
